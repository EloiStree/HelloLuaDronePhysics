I was wondering something... Developers can make drone games, but the physics are often poor. Could we, as a community, code some physics in Lua?

Drones are simple in concept:
Two joysticks control position and rotation.

I highly doubt that drone physics are computed using multithreading or GPU. So Lua should do the trick.

So, could we not make a Unity3D Lua game to prove this theory? And if, in practice, Lua is good enough at 90%, then we can all make drone games and choose the physics we want by changing a URL in the game.
